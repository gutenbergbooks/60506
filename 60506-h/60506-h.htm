<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Poetry</span> is a mere drug,” say the publishers; “bring us no more poetry,
it won’t sell.”</p>

<p>“Poetry is a terrible bore,” say a majority of the dear public; “it is
too high-flown; we can’t understand it.”</p>

<p>To all this, we are tempted to reply in the language of doctor Abernethy
to one of his patients. The good old lady, when the doctor entered the
room, raised her arm to her head, and drawing her face into a very
painful expression, exclaimed, “Oh, oh! O dear, Doctor, it almost kills
me to lift my arm up so; what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Well, madam,” said the doctor, gravely, “then you must be a very great
fool to lift your arm up so.”</p>

<p>Leaving the reader to make the application, we hasten to deny the
premises assumed by the publishers and a portion of the public. What
they say, is not true of <i>poetry</i>; it is in direct contradiction to the
experience of the world in all ages and all nations, for thousands of
years. But it may be true, and <i>is</i> true, of endless masses of words
that are poured forth from the press under the <i>name</i> of poetry. But we
do not believe, that genuine poetry, that which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> worthy of the name,
is either “a drug,” or “too high-flown” to be enjoyed and understood by
the mass of the reading public.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The budding twigs spread out their fan,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To catch the breezy air;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I must think, do all I can,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That there was pleasure there.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Poetry like that, will always find readers and admirers among all
classes, whether high or low, rich or poor, learned or unlearned. True
poetry is the unsophisticated language of nature&mdash;so plain and simple,
that he that runs may read. In proof of this, it is found, that among
the writings of popular authors, those poems most marked for simple and
natural language, other things being equal, are always the most popular.
There must be taste and judgment in the selection of subjects, for many
subjects are in their nature unsuited to the true spirit of poetry.</p>

<p>The author of Powhatan does not presume to claim for his production the
merit of good and genuine poetry; nor does he pretend to assign it a
place in the classes or forms into which poetry is divided. He has
chosen to call it a metrical romance, as a title of less pretension than
that of poem; and he is perfectly willing that others should call it by
whatever name they please. Whatever may be its faults, they must rest
solely upon the author. They cannot be chargeable to the subject, for
that is full of interest, and dignity, and poetry. Nor can they be
palliated by the plea of hasty composition; for he has had the work on
his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> hands at intervals for several years, though to be sure something
more than half of it has been written within the year past. Of one thing
the author feels confident; but whether it may be regarded as adding to,
or detracting from, the merit of the work, he knows not; he believes it
would be difficult to find a poem that embodies more truly the spirit of
history, or indeed that follows out more faithfully many of its details.
Of the justness of this remark, some evidence may be found in the notes
attached to the work.</p>

<p>Finally, with regard to its merits, the test by which the author desires
to be tried, is the common taste of <i>common readers</i>. If <i>they</i> shall
read it with pleasure, and if the impression made by its perusal shall
induce them to recur to it again with renewed delight, he will care
little for the rules by which critics may judge it, but will find
satisfaction in the assurance that he has added something honorable to
the literature of his country.</p>

<h2><a name="SKETCH_OF_THE_CHARACTER_OF_POWHATAN" id="SKETCH_OF_THE_CHARACTER_OF_POWHATAN"></a>SKETCH OF THE CHARACTER OF POWHATAN.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As Powhatan may be regarded as the most prominent personage in the
poem, the author has thought proper to give the following
well-drawn sketch of his character a place at the commencement of
the work, rather than among the notes at the end. It is extracted
from Burk’s “History of Virginia,” and will serve to show that
grave and sober history assigns to the Indian chieftain a rank no
less elevated and dignified than is given him in the following
poem.</p></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> greater part of his life was passed in what is generally termed
glory and good fortune. In the cant of civilization, he will doubtless
be branded with the epithets of tyrant and barbarian. But his title to
greatness, although his opportunities were fewer, is to the full as fair
as that of Tamerlane or Kowli Khan, and several others, whom history has
immortalized as conquerors; while the proofs of his tyranny are by no
means so clear and unequivocal.</p>

<p>“Born to a slender patrimony, in the midst of numerous tribes more
subtle than the Arabs of the desert, and whose independence spurned even
the shadow of restraint, he contrived, by his valor and address, to
unite them in one firm and indissoluble union, under his power and
authority; giving his name to the new empire which his wisdom had
erected, and which continued to flourish under his auspices and
direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span></p>

<p>“As a warrior, bold, skilful, and enterprising, he was confessedly
without rival or competitor; inspiring with respect or terror even the
formidable enemies who dared to make head against his encroachments. The
powerful confederacy of the Manakins and Manahoacks, and the more
distant inhabitants of the lakes, heard the name of Powhatan with
uneasiness and alarm.</p>

<p>“At the coming of the English he had reached the advanced age of sixty
years, and enjoyed in the bosom of his family the fruits of his long and
glorious exertions. The spectacle of men who came from beyond the sea,
in floating and winged houses, and who fought with thunder and
lightnings, could not fail to strike him by its grandeur and novelty.
The intent of the strangers appeared, at first view, to be friendly; and
he received them with courtesy. But his sagacious mind quickly developed
the motives, and foresaw the consequences, of their arrival. He looked
forward with regret to a renewal of his labors; and, at the age of
sixty, he resolved to fight over again the battles of his youth. He
might have lived in peace. He was aware of the superiority of his new
enemy in the machines and instruments of battle, as well as in their
discipline and experience; but these cold calculations vanished before
his sense of honor and independence. Age could not chill the ardor of
his heroic bosom.</p>

<p>“In the private circle of his family, who appears to greater advantage
than Powhatan?&mdash;what affection for his brothers! how delicate and
considerate his regard for his children! what moderation and pity does
he not manifest towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> Captain Smith, when, subdued by the tears of
Pocahontas, and touched, perhaps, with compassion for the bravery and
misfortunes of his captive, he consented to spare his life!</p>

<p>“Powhatan comes before us without any of those mortifying and abasing
circumstances which, in the eye of human respect, diminish the lustre of
reputation. History records no violence offered to his person; no
insulting language used in his presence. Opechancanough had been dragged
by the hair, at the head of hundreds of Indians; but never had the
majesty of Powhatan been violated by personal insult.</p>

<p>“In all disputes and conferences with the English, he never once forgets
that he is a monarch; never permits others to forget it. ‘If your king,’
said he to Smith, ‘has sent me presents, <i>I too am a king, and I am in
my own land</i>.’ No matter who the person is whom the partiality of the
historian may think proper to distinguish as his hero; we never lose
sight of the manly figure and venerable majesty of the Indian hero. He
is always the principal figure in the group; and in his presence, even
the gallant and adventurous Smith is obliged to play a second part; and
all others are forgotten.</p>

<p>“Owing to that obscurity in which, unhappily, every thing relating to
this people is involved, we know little of the dawn of Powhatan’s
glory&mdash;little of his meridian. Those particular traits which would have
enabled us accurately to estimate the character and capacity of his
mind, have felt the fate of oral record and remembrance. The exploits of
his youth and his manhood have perished, for the want of a poet or
historian. We saw him only for a short time, on the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> of the
horizon; but, from the brightness of his departing beams, we can easily
think what he was in the blaze of his fame.</p>

<p>“If we view him as a statesman, a character which has been thought to
demand a greater comprehension and variety of talents, where shall we
find one who merited in a higher degree the palm of distinction and
eminence? ’Tis true the theatre of his administration was neither wide
nor conspicuous. He is not set off by the splendid machinery of palaces
and courtiers, glittering with gold and precious stones; or the costly
equipage of dress. He had no troops in rich uniform; he had no treasury;
he maintained no ambassadors at foreign courts. Powhatan must be viewed
as he stands in relation to the several Indian nations of Virginia. To
judge him by European ideas of greatness would be the climax of
injustice and absurdity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span>”</p>

<span class="i0">Unbroken faith to all who fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would still be bound in friendship’s chain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, one by one, that warrior train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smoked the long calumet again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gravely pass’d it round the ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, last of all, Pamunky’s king<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Susquehannah’s giant race.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>This powerful tribe, dwelling along the valley of the Susquehannah,
bearing the name of that noble stream, and commanding its waters even to
the head of Chesapeake Bay, is represented by the early adventurers in
Virginia to have been a race of gigantic stature. The romantic spirit of
Captain Smith, delighting as he did in the marvellous, probably may have
given some coloring to his descriptions in matters of mere opinion, but
where he describes facts that came within his knowledge, his truth and
candor may always be relied upon. He says, “Such great and
well-proportioned men are seldom seen; for they seemed like giants to
the English, yea, and to the neighbors, yet seemed of an honest and
simple disposition, with much ado restrained from adoring us as gods.”</p>

<p>The following curious account of this tribe is from the grave and
matter-of-fact historian Stith; borrowed however principally from Smith.</p>

<p>“Their language and attire were very suitable to their stature and
appearance. For their language sounded deep and solemn, and hollow, like
a voice in a vault. Their attire was the skins of bears and wolves, so
cut that the man’s head went through the neck, and the ears of the bear
were fastened on his shoulders, while the nose and teeth hung dangling
down upon his breast. Behind, was another bear’s face split, with a paw
hanging at the nose. And their sleeves coming down to their elbows, were
the necks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> of bears, with their arms going through the mouth, and paws
hanging to the nose. One had the head of a wolf, hanging to a chain, for
a jewel; and his tobacco pipe was three-quarters of a yard long, carved
with a bird, a deer, and other devices at the great end, which was
sufficient to beat out a man’s brains. They measured the calf of the
largest man’s leg, and found it three-quarters of a yard about, and all
the rest of his limbs were in proportion; so that he seemed the
stateliest and most goodly personage they had ever beheld. His arrows
were three-quarters long, headed with splinters of a white crystal-like
stone, in the form of a heart, an inch broad, and an inch and a half
long. These he carried at his back, in a wolf’s skin for a quiver, with
his bow in one hand and his club in the other.”</p>

<p>All accounts agree that Powhatan had under his dominion thirty tribes,
and some of our chronicles locate them as follows. Ten tribes between
the Potomac and Rappahannock, five between the Rappahannock and York,
eight between the York and James, five between the James River and the
borders of Carolina, and two on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span></p>

Werowocomoco, on York River, about ten or a dozen miles from Jamestown;

land his brethren and kindred did murther one another, he provided a
number of ships, and got with him such men and women as were desirous to
live in quietnesse, that arrived with him in this new land in the year
1170; left many of his people there and returned for more. But where
this place was no history can show.”&mdash;<i>Captain John Smith.</i></p>

<p>“On the death of Owen Gwyneth, king of North Wales, A. D. 1169, his
children disputed the succession. Yorwerth, the elder, was set aside
without a struggle, as being incapacitated by a blemish in his face.
Hoel obtained possession of the throne for awhile, till he was defeated
and slain by David, the eldest son of the late king by a second wife.
The conqueror, who then succeeded without opposition, slew Yorwerth,
imprisoned Rodri, and hunted others of his brethren into exile. But
Madoc meantime abandoned his barbarous country, and sailed away to the
west in search of some better resting-place. The land which he
discovered pleased him. He left there part of his people, and went back
to Wales for a fresh supply of adventurers, with whom he again set sail,
and was heard of no more.”&mdash;<i>Preface to Southey’s Madoc.</i></p>

<p>The following brief biographical sketch of Capt. John Smith is quoted in
Burk’s Virginia, as from “a late American biographer;” [probably
Belknap.]</p>

<p>“He was born at Willoughby, in Lincolnshire [England] in the year one
thousand five hundred and seventy-nine. From the first dawn of reason he
discovered a roving and romantic genius, and delighted in extravagant
and daring actions among his school-fellows. When about thirteen years
of age, he sold his books and satchel, and his puerile trinkets, to
raise money, with a view to convey himself privately to sea; but the
death of his father put a stop for the present to this attempt, and
threw him into the hands of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span>guardians, who endeavored to check the
ardor of his genius, by confining him to a compting house. Being put
apprentice to a merchant at Lynn, at the age of fifteen, he at first
conceived hopes that his master would send him to sea in his service;
but this hope failing, he quitted his master, and with only ten
shillings in his pocket, entered into the train of a young nobleman who
was travelling to France.</p>

<p>“At Orleans he was discharged from his attendance on Lord Bertie, and
had money given to return to England.</p>

<p>“With this money he visited Paris, and proceeded to the Low Countries,
where he enlisted as a soldier, and learned the rudiments of war, a
science peculiarly agreeable to his ardent and active genius. Meeting
with a Scots gentleman abroad, he was persuaded to pass into Scotland,
with the promise of being strongly recommended to King James. But being
baffled in this expectation, he returned to his native town, and finding
no company there, which suited his taste, he built a booth in the wood,
and betook himself to the study of military history and tactics,
diverting himself at intervals with his horse and lance; in which
exercises he at length found a companion, an Italian gentleman, rider to
the Earl of Lincoln, who drew him from his sylvan retreat to Tattersal.</p>

<p>“Having recovered a part of the estate which his father had left him, he
put himself into a better condition than before, and set off again on
his travels, in the winter of the year one thousand five hundred and
ninety-six, being then only seventeen years of age. His first stage was
Flanders, where meeting with a Frenchman, who pretended to be heir<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span> to a
noble family, he with his three attendants prevailed upon Smith to go
with them to France. In a dark night they arrived at St. Valory, in
Picardy, and by the connivance of the shipmaster, the Frenchmen were
carried ashore with the trunks of our young traveller, whilst he was
left on board till the return of the boat. In the mean time they had
conveyed the baggage out of his reach, and were not to be found. A
sailor on board, who knew the villains, generously undertook to conduct
him to Mortain, where they lived, and supplied his wants till their
arrival at the place. Here he found their friends, from whom he could
get no recompense, but the report of his sufferings induced several
persons of distinction to invite him to their houses.</p>

<p>“Eager to pursue his travels, and not caring to receive favors which he
was unable to requite, he left his new friends, and went from port to
port in search of a ship of war. In one of these rambles near Dinan, it
was his chance to meet one of the villains who had robbed him. Without
speaking a word, they both drew; and Smith having wounded and disarmed
his antagonist, obliged him to confess his guilt before a number of
persons, who had assembled on the occasion. Satisfied with his victory,
he retired to the seat of an acquaintance, the Earl of Ployer, who had
been brought up in England; and having received supplies from him, he
travelled along the French coast to Bayonne, and from thence crossed
over to Marseilles; visiting and observing every thing in his way, which
had any reference to military or naval architecture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span></p>

<p>“At Marseilles he embarked for Italy, in company with a rabble of
pilgrims. The ship was forced by a tempest into the harbor of Toulon,
and afterwards obliged by a contrary wind to anchor under the little
island of St. Mary, off Nice, in Savoy. The bigotry of the pilgrims made
them ascribe their ill-fortune to the presence of a heretic on board.
They devoutly cursed Smith and his queen, Elizabeth, and in a fit of
pious rage threw him into the sea. He swam to the island, and the next
day was taken on board a ship of St. Malo which had also put in there
for shelter. The master of the ship, who was well known to his noble
friend the Earl of Ployer, entertained him kindly, and carried him to
Alexandria in Egypt; from thence he coasted the Levant, and on his
return had the high satisfaction of an engagement with a Venetian ship,
which they took and rifled of her rich cargo.</p>

<p>“Smith was set on shore at Antibes, with a box of one thousand chequins,
(about two thousand dollars,) by the help of which he made the tour of
Italy, crossed the Adriatic, and travelled into Stiria, to the seat of
Ferdinand, archduke of Austria. Here he met with an English and Irish
Jesuit, who introduced him to Lord Eberspaught, Baron Kisel, and other
officers of distinction; and here he found full scope for his genius;
for the emperor being then at war with the Turks, he entered into his
army as a volunteer.</p>

<p>“He communicated to Eberspaught a method of conversing at a distance by
signals made with torches, which being alternately shown and hidden a
certain number of times, designated every letter of the alphabet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span></p>

<p>“He had soon after an opportunity of making the experiment. Eberspaught,
being besieged by the Turks in the strong town of Olimpack, was cut off
from all intelligence and hope of succor from his friends. Smith
proposed his method of communication to Baron Kisel, who approved it,
and allowed him to put it in practice. He was conveyed by a guard to a
hill within view of the town, and sufficiently remote from the Turkish
camp. At the display of the signal, Eberspaught knew and answered it;
and Smith conveyed to him this intelligence: ‘Thursday night I will
charge on the east; at the alarm, sally thou.’ The answer was, ‘I will.’</p>

<p>“Just before the attack, by Smith’s advice, a great number of false
fires were made in another quarter, which divided the attention of the
enemy, and gave advantage to the assailants; who being assisted by a
sally from the town, killed many of the Turks, drove others into the
river, and threw succors into the place, which obliged the enemy next
day to raise the siege. This well-conducted exploit produced to our
young adventurer the command of a company, consisting of two hundred and
fifty horsemen, in the regiment of Count Meldrich, a nobleman of
Transylvania.</p>

<p>“The regiment in which he served, being engaged in several hazardous
enterprises, Smith was foremost in all dangers, and distinguished
himself by his ingenuity and by his valor: and when Meldrich left the
imperial army and passed into the service of his native prince, Smith
followed him.</p>

<p>“At the siege of Regal, the Ottomans derided the slow approaches of the
Transylvanian army, and sent a challenge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span> purporting that the lord
Turbisha, to divert the ladies, would fight any single captain of the
Christian troops.</p>

<p>“The honor of accepting this challenge, being determined by lot, fell on
Captain Smith; who meeting his antagonist on horseback, within view of
the ladies on the battlements, at the sound of music began the
encounter, and in a short time killed him, and bore away his head in
triumph to his general, the lord Moyzes.</p>

<p>“The death of the chief so irritated his friend Crualgo, that he sent a
particular challenge to the conqueror, who, meeting him with the same
ceremonies, after a smart combat, took off his head also.</p>

<p>“Smith then in his turn sent a message into the town, informing the
ladies, that if they wished for more diversion, they should be welcome
to his head, in case their third champion could take it.</p>

<p>“The challenge was accepted by Bonamalgro, who unhorsed Smith, and was
near gaining the victory; but remounting in a critical moment he gave
the Turk a stroke with his falchion, which brought him to the ground,
and his head was added to the number.</p>

<p>“For these singular exploits he was honored with a military procession,
consisting of six thousand men, three led horses, and the Turks’ heads
on the points of their lances. With this ceremony Smith was conducted to
the pavilion of his general, who, after embracing him, presented him
with a horse richly furnished, a scymetar and belt worth three hundred
ducats, and a commission to be major in his regiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span></p>

<p>“The prince of Transylvania, after the capture of the place, made him a
present of his picture set in gold, and a pension of three hundred
ducats per annum; and moreover granted him a coat of arms, bearing three
Turks’ heads in a shield.</p>

<p>“The patent was admitted and received in the college of heralds in
England, by Sir Henry Segar, garter king at arms. Smith was always proud
of this distinguished honor, and these arms are accordingly blazoned in
the frontispiece to his history, with this motto, ‘<i>Vincere est
vivere</i>.’</p>

<p>“After this, the Transylvanian army was defeated by a body of Turks and
Tartars near Rotention, and many brave men were slain, among whom were
nine English and Scots officers, who, after the fashion of that day, had
entered into this service, from a religious zeal to drive the Turks out
of Christendom.</p>

<p>“Smith was wounded in this battle and lay among the dead. His habit
discovered him to the victors as a person of consequence; they used him
well till his wounds were healed, and then sold him to the Basha Bogul,
who sent him as a present to his mistress, Tragabigzanda at
Constantinople, accompanied with a message, as full of vanity as void of
truth, that he had conquered a Bohemian nobleman, and presented him to
her as a slave.</p>

<p>“The present proved more acceptable to the lady than her lord intended.
She could speak Italian; and Smith in that language not only informed
her of his country and quality, but conversed with her in so pleasing a
manner as to gain her affections. The connection proved so tender, that
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span> secure him for herself, and to prevent his being ill-used, she sent
him to her brother, the bashaw of Nalbraitz, in the country of the
Cambrian Tartars on the borders of the sea of Azoph. Her pretence was,
that he should there learn the manners and language as well as religion
of the Tartars.</p>

<p>“By the terms in which she wrote to her brother, he suspected her
design, and resolved to disappoint her. Within an hour after Smith’s
arrival he was stripped, his head and beard were shaven, an iron collar
was put about his neck, he was clothed with a coat of hair-cloth, and
driven to labor among the Christian slaves.</p>

<p>“He had now no hope of redemption, but from the love of his mistress,
who was at a great distance, and not likely to be informed of his
misfortunes. The hopeless condition of his fellow slaves could not
alleviate his despondency.</p>

<p>“In the depth of his distress an opportunity presented for an escape,
which to a person of less courageous and adventurous spirit would have
been an aggravation of misery. He was employed in threshing at a grange
in a large field, about a league from the house of his tyrant; who in
his daily visits treated him with abusive language, accompanied with
blows and kicks.</p>

<p>“This was more than Smith could bear; wherefore watching an opportunity,
when no other person was present, he levelled a stroke at him with his
threshing instrument, which dispatched him.</p>

<p>“Then hiding his body in the straw, and shutting the door, he filled a
bag with grain, mounted the bashaw’s horse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span> betaking himself to the
desert, wandered for two or three days, ignorant of the way, and so
fortunate as not to meet with a single person, who might give
information of his flight.</p>

<p>“At length he came to a post, erected in a cross road, by the marks on
which he found the way to Muscovy, and in sixteen days he arrived at
Exapolis, on the river Don; where was a Russian garrison, the commander
of which, understanding that he was a Christian, received him
courteously, took off his iron collar, and gave him letters to the other
governors in that region.</p>

<p>“Thus he travelled through part of Russia and Poland, till he got back
to his friends in Transylvania; receiving presents in his way from many
persons of distinction, among whom he particularly mentions a charitable
lady, Callamata, being always proud of his connection with that sex, and
fond of acknowledging their favors. At Leipsic he met with his colonel,
Count Meldrich, and Sigismund, prince of Transylvania, who gave him one
thousand five hundred ducats to repair his losses.</p>

<p>“With this money he was enabled to travel through Germany, France, and
Spain, and having visited the kingdom of Morocco, he returned by sea to
England; having in his passage enjoyed the pleasure of another naval
engagement.</p>

<p>“At his arrival in his native country, he had a thousand ducats in his
purse, which, with the interest he had remaining in England, he devoted
to seek adventures and make discoveries in North America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Reader, if thou hast perused the preceding sketch of the life of Captain
Smith, pause one moment, and reflect, that all that is here recorded, he
performed, passed through, and suffered, before he came to the wild
shores of the new world. And that here he entered upon a new field of
enterprise, and of suffering, and of daring, not less remarkable than
the scenes which had already given such wonderful interest to his
eventful life. Follow him to the wilderness of Virginia, and witness the
toils and struggles he went through to plant the first European
settlement in these states. Behold him the guardian spirit of the little
colony, in repeated instances and in various ways protecting it by his
single arm from utter destruction. When the colony was sinking under
famine, the energy and activity of Smith always brought them food; when
beset by the subtle and ferocious tribes around them, the courage and
skill of Smith never failed to prove a safe and sufficient shield for
their protection. When traitors among them sought to rob and abandon the
colony, they were detected by his penetration and punished by his power.
It mattered not what nominal rank he held in the colony, whether vested
with office, or filling only the humble post of a private individual, it
was to him that all eyes were turned in times of difficulty and danger,
and it was his name alone that struck terror to the hearts of the
hostile savages.</p>

<p>With a dozen men in an open boat, he performs a voyage of a thousand
miles, surveying the shores of the great Chesapeake Bay and exploring
its noble tributary streams, with thousands of the wild sons of the
forest ready to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span> him at every turn. When, in the cabin of the
powerful chief Opechancanough, five hundred warriors, armed with bow and
club, surrounded him with a determination to seize him and put him to
death, who but Captain John Smith would have extricated himself from his
perilous situation? Nothing daunted, he seized the giant chieftain by
the hair of his head with one hand, held a pistol to his breast with the
other, and led him out trembling among his people, and made them throw
down their arms.</p>

<p>In short, for romantic adventure, “hair-breadth escapes,” the sublimity
of courage, high and honorable feeling, and true worth of character, the
history of the world may be challenged to produce a parallel to Captain
John Smith, the founder of Virginia.</p>

<p>“Every object that struck their senses, as they sailed up the
Chesapeake, was well calculated to awaken hope in the minds of the
adventurers. They were almost enclosed in one of the most spacious bays
in the world; whilst the rich verdure, with which a genial and early
spring had clad the forest, ascending from the edge of the shore to the
summits of the hills, presented a prospect at once regular and
magnificent. It was a sort of vast amphitheatre, the limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span> of which
were the horizon; and when to the real beauty of the landscape, be added
the ardent spirit of adventure, which delights in the marvellous, and
kindles and dilates itself by the enthusiasm of fancy; there is little
cause for our surprise at the glowing descriptions of the first
settlers, who represented it as a kind of earthly paradise or
elisium.”&mdash;<i>Burk’s History of Virginia.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>There is a simplicity and an occasional richness in the original
descriptions of Captain Smith, which cannot fail to be relished by the
reader.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>“There is but one entrance by sea into this country, and that is at the
mouth of a very goodly bay eighteen or twenty miles broad. The cape at
the south is Cape Henry, in honor of our most noble prince. The land
white hilly sands, like unto the Downes, and all along the shores great
plentie of pines and firres.</p>

<p>“The north cape is called Cape Charles, in honor of the worthy Duke of
Yorke; the isles before it, Smith’s Isles, by the name of the
discoverer. Within is a country that may have the prerogative over the
most pleasant places knowne, for large and pleasant navigable rivers;
heaven and earth never agreed better to frame a place for man’s
habitation. Here are mountains, hills, plains, valleys, rivers, and
brookes, all running most pleasantly into a faire bay, compassed but for
the mouth with fruitful and delightsome land.</p>

<p>“The mountains are of divers natures; for at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span> the bay the
rockes are of a composition like millstones. Some of marble, &amp;c. And
many pieces like christall, we found, as throwne downe by water from
those mountains. These waters wash from the rockes such glistering
tinctures, that the ground in some places seemeth as guilded, where both
the rockes and the earth are so splendent to behold, <i>that better
judgements than ours might have beene persuaded they contained more than
probabilities</i>. The vesture of the earth in most places doth manifestly
prove the nature of the soyle to be lusty and very rich.</p>

<p>“The country is not mountainous, nor yet low; but such pleasant plaines,
hils, and fertile valleyes, one prettily crossing another, and watered
so conveniently with fresh brooks and springs, no less commodious and
delightsome. By the rivers are many plaine marishes. Other plaines there
are few, but only where the savages inhabit; but all overgrowne with
trees and weeds, being a plaine wilderness as God first made it.</p>

<p>“The windes here are variable, but the like thunder and lightning to
purify the air, I have seldome either seene or heard in
Europe.”&mdash;<i>Smith’s Virginia, published in London, 1629.</i></p>

the western continent, under the patronage of Sir Walter Raleigh, the
author says, “The second of July they fell with the coast of Florida in
shoule water, where they felt a most delicate sweete smell. They found
their first landing-place very sandy and low, but so full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span> grapes,
that the very surge of the sea sometimes overflowed them; of which they
found such plenty in all places, both on the sand, the greene soyle and
hils, as in the plaines, as well on every little shrub, as also climbing
towards the tops of high cedars, that they did thinke in the world were
not the like abundance.” * * * *</p>

<p>“Discharging our muskets, such a flocke of cranes, the most white, arose
by us, with such a cry as if an army of men had shouted altogether.”</p>

<p>The woods contained “the highest and reddest cedars of the world,
bettering them of the Assores, Indies or Libanus; pines, cypress,
saxefras, the lentish that beareth mastick, and many other of excellent
smell and quality.”</p>

<p>“The soyle is most plentifull, sweete, wholesome, and fruitfull of all
other; there are about fourteen severall sorts of sweete smelling tymber
trees; such oaks as we, but far greater and better.”</p>

<p>Though the colony were several times threatened with famine while
Captain Smith remained with them, yet the activity, talents and vigorous
exertions of that remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span> man never failed to bring them a timely
supply of provisions.</p>

<p>But after Smith was compelled, in consequence of a wound received from
an explosion of gunpowder, to return to England, the sufferings of the
colony were almost unparalleled. The following sad picture of the
extremities to which they were reduced, is given by one of the writers
in Smith’s History of Virginia.</p>

<p>“Of five hundred, within six months after Captain Smith’s departure,
there remained not past sixtie men, women, and children, most miserable
and poor creatures; and those were preserved for the most part, by
roots, herbes, acorns, walnuts, berries, now and then a little fish.
They that had starch in these extremities made no small use of it; yea,
even the very skins of our horses. Nay, so great was our famine, that a
savage we slew and buried, the poorer sort took him up again and eat
him, and so did divers one another, boyled and stewed with roots and
herbes. And one among the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had
eaten part of her before it was knowne, for which he was executed, as
hee well deserved. Now whether she was better roasted, boyled or
carbonadoed, I know not, but of such a dish as powdered wife I never
heard of. This was that time, which still to this day we called the
starving time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span>”</p>

such conclusions as necessitie inforced, though contrary to his
commission; let fly his muskets, ran his boat on shore, whereat they all
fled into the woods. So, marching towards their houses, they might see
great heapes of corne. Much adoe he had to restrain his hungry soldiers
from present taking of it, expecting, as it happened, that the savages
would assault them, as not long after they did with a most hideous

Okee, and give them beads, copper, and hatchets besides; which on both
sides was to their contents performed. And then they brought him

dancing in signe of friendship till they departed.”&mdash;<i>Smith’s Virginia.</i></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>After Captain Smith had been taken prisoner by Opechancanough, he was
led in triumph through several of the tribes and witnessed many of the
strange ceremonies of the Indians, till at last he was brought to the
residence of the Emperor Powhatan. The scenes which occurred there, are
described as follows, by John Burk in his History of Virginia, a work of
which only one volume was completed, bringing the history down no later
than 1624. This volume is highly valuable as far as it goes, and
exhibits so much ability as to make it a matter of much regret that the
author did not live to complete his work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span></p>

<p>“On the entrance of Smith, Powhatan was dressed in a cloak made of the
skins of the racoon. On either hand of the chief sat two young girls,
his daughters. His counsellors, adorned with shells and feathers, were
ranged on each side of the house, with an equal number of women standing
behind them. On Smith’s entrance, the attendants of Powhatan shouted.
The queen of Appamattox was appointed to bring him water to wash, whilst
another dried his hands with a bunch of feathers.</p>

<p>“A consultation of the emperor and his council having taken place, it
was adjudged expedient to put Smith to death, as a man whose superior
courage and genius made him peculiarly dangerous to the safety of the
Indians. The decision being made known to the attendants of the emperor,
preparations immediately commenced for carrying it into execution by
means as simple and summary as the nature of the trial.</p>

<p>“Two large stones were brought in and placed at the feet of the emperor;
and on them was laid the head of the prisoner. Next a large club was
brought in, with which Powhatan, for whom out of respect was reserved
the honor, prepared to crush the head of his captive. The assembly
looked on with sensations of awe, probably not unmixed with pity for the
fate of an enemy whose bravery had commanded their admiration, and in
whose misfortunes their hatred was possibly forgotten.</p>

<p>“The fatal club was uplifted; the breasts of the company already, by
anticipation, felt the dreadful crash, which was to bereave the wretched
victim of life; when the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span> and beautiful Pocahontas, the beloved
daughter of the emperor, with a shriek of terror and agony, threw
herself on the body of Smith. Her hair was loose and her eyes streaming
with tears, while her whole manner bespoke the deep distress and agony
of her bosom. She cast a beseeching look at her furious and astonished
father, deprecating his wrath, and imploring his pity and the life of
his prisoner, with all the eloquence of mute, but impassioned sorrow.</p>

<p>“The remainder of this scene is honorable to the character of Powhatan.
It will remain a lasting monument, that, though different principles of
action and the influence of custom have given to the manners and
opinions of this people an appearance neither amiable nor virtuous, they
still retain the noblest property of the human character, the touch of
pity, and the feeling of humanity.</p>

<p>“The club of the emperor was still uplifted; but pity had touched his
bosom, and his eye was every moment losing its fierceness. He looked
round to collect his fortitude, or perhaps to find an excuse for his
weakness in the faces of his attendants. But every eye was suffused with
the sweetly contagious softness. The generous savage no longer
hesitated. The compassion of the rude state is neither ostentatious nor
dilatory; nor does it insult its object by the exaction of impossible
conditions. Powhatan lifted his grateful and delighted daughter, and the
captive, scarcely yet assured of safety, from the earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187">{187}</a></span>”</p>

<p>Powhatan having refused to go to Jamestown to receive the royal presents
which Newport had brought from King James, it was decided that Newport
and Smith should go to his residence with a file of men, and invest him
with the robe of state and crown agreeably to King James’s request. A
brief account of the ceremony is given in the quaint language of Captain
Smith, as follows.</p>

<p>“The presents were sent by water, and the captains went by land with
fifty good shot. All being met at Werowocomoco, the next day was
appointed for his coronation. Then the presents were brought in, his
bason and ewer, bed and furniture set up, his scarlet cloak and apparell
with much adoe put on him, being perswaded by Namontack they would not
hurt him. But a foule trouble there was to make him kneele to receive
his crowne, he neither knowing the majesty nor meaning of a crowne, nor
bending of the knee, endured so many perswasions, examples, and
instructions, as tyred them all. At last, by leaning hard on his
shoulders, he a little stooped, and three having the crowne in their
hands put it on his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span>”</p>

</div>

<p>SKETCH OF THE CHARACTER OF POCAHONTAS.</p>

<p>“The character of this interesting woman, as it stands in the concurrent
accounts of all our historians, is not, it is with confidence affirmed,
surpassed by any in the whole range of history; and for those qualities
more especially, which do honor to our nature&mdash;a humane and feeling
heart, an ardor and unshaken constancy in her attachments&mdash;she stands
almost without a rival.</p>

<p>“At the first appearance of the Europeans, her young heart was impressed
with admiration of the persons and manners of the strangers. But it is
not during their prosperity that she displays her attachment. She is not
influenced by awe of their greatness, or fear of their resentment, in
the assistance she affords them. It was during their severest
distresses, when their most celebrated chief was a captive in their
hands, and was dragged through the country, as a spectacle for the sport
and derision of her people, that she places herself between them and
destruction.</p>

<p>“The spectacle of Pocahontas in an attitude of entreaty, with her hair
loose, and her eyes streaming with tears, supplicating her enraged
father for the life of Captain Smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span> when he is about to crush the
head of his prostrate victim with a club, is a situation equal to the
genius of Raphael. And when the royal savage directs his ferocious
glance for a moment from his victim, to reprove his weeping daughter;
when, softened by her distress, his eye loses its fierceness, and he
gives his captive to her tears, the painter will discover a new occasion
for exercising his talents.</p>

<p>“In Pocahontas we have to admire, not the softer virtues only; she is
found, when the interest of her friends demands it, full of foresight
and intrepidity.</p>

<p>“When a conspiracy is planned for the extermination of the English, she
eludes the jealous vigilance of her father, and ventures at midnight,
through a thousand perils, to apprise them of their danger.</p>

<p>“But in no situation does she appear to more advantage, than when,
disgusted with the cold formalities of a court (in England) and the
impertinent and troublesome curiosity of the people, she addressed the
feeling and pathetic remonstrance to Captain Smith on the distant
coldness of his manner. Briefly she stated the rise and progress of
their friendship; modestly she pointed out the services she had rendered
him; concluding with an affecting picture of her situation, at a
distance from her country and family, and surrounded by strangers in a
strange land.</p>

<p>“Indeed there is ground for apprehension that posterity, in reading this
part of American history, will be inclined to consider the story of
Pocahontas as an interesting romance; perhaps recalling the palpable
fictions of early travellers and navigators, they may suppose that in
those times<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span> a portion of fiction was deemed essential to the
embellishment of history. It is not even improbable, that considering
every thing relating to Captain Smith and Pocahontas as a mere fiction,
they may vent their spleen against the historian for impairing the
interest of his plot by marrying the princess of Powhatan to a Mr. Rolf,
of whom nothing had previously been said, in defiance of all the
expectations raised by the foregoing parts of the fable.</p>

<p>“It is the last sad office of history to record the fate of this
incomparable woman. The severe muse, which presides over this
department, cannot plant the cypress over her grave, and consign her to
the tomb, with the stately pomp and graceful tears of poetry. She cannot
with pious sorrow inurn the ashes and immortalize the virtues of the
dead by the soul-piercing elegy, which fancy, mysterious deity, pours
out, wild and plaintive, her hair loose, and her white bosom throbbing
with anguish. Those things are placed equally beyond her reach and her
inclination. But history affects not to conceal her sorrow on this
occasion.</p>

<p>“She died at Gravesend, (England,) where she was preparing to embark
with her husband and son on her return to Virginia. Her death was a
happy mixture of Indian fortitude and Christian submission, affecting
all those who saw her, by the lively and edifying picture of piety and
virtue which marked her latter moments.”&mdash;<i>Burk’s Virginia.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever account Japazaws may have given of the capture of Metoka, or
Pocahontas, history attributes the incident altogether to his own
treachery. She was carried away by Captain Argall, who was up the
Potomac with his vessel for the purpose of trading with the natives. The
following account is copied from Burk.</p>

<p>“By the means of Japazaws, king of Potomac, he discovered that
Pocahontas was concealed in the neighborhood, and he immediately
conceived the design of getting her into his power; concluding that the
possession of so valuable an hostage would operate as a check on the
hostile dispositions of the emperor, and might perhaps be made an
instrument of peace and reconciliation. The integrity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span> Japazaws was
not proof against the seducing appearance of a copper kettle, which was
fixed as the price of his treachery; and this amiable maiden, whose soul
nature formed on one of her kindest and noblest models, was betrayed by
her perfidious host into the hands of a people, whom her tender and
compassionate spirit had often snatched from famine and the sword.</p>

<p>“For the causes of this princess’s absence from her father, we are left
to bare conjecture. Her avowed partiality for the English had probably
drawn down on her the displeasure of this high-spirited monarch; and she
had retired to avoid the effects of his immediate resentment.”</p>

<p>The great massacre of the Virginia colony by the Indians in 1622, is
thus described by Burk.</p>

<p>“Whilst the colony was thus rapidly advancing to eminence and wealth,
she carried in her bosom and about her an enemy which was to blight her
budding honors, and which brought near to ruin and desolation her
growing establishment. Since the marriage of Pocahontas, the natives had
lived on terms of uninterrupted and apparently cordial amity with the
English, which daily gained strength by mutual wants and necessities.
Each had something beyond their wants, which the other stood in need of.
And commerce, regulated by good faith, and a spirit of justice, gave
facility to the exchange or barter of their superfluous productions. The
consequence of this state of things was, a complete security on the part
of the English; a total disregard and disuse of military precautions and
martial exercises. The time and the hands of labor were considered too
valuable to be employed in an idle and holiday array of arms; and in
this situation, wholly intent on amassing wealth, and totally unprovided
for defence, they were attacked by an enemy, whose resentment no time
nor good offices could disarm; whose preparations were silent as night;
to whom the arts of native cunning had given a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span> deep dissimulation, an
exterior so specious, as might impose on suspicion itself.</p>

<p>“Opechancanough (who succeeded Powhatan in the government) possessed a
powerful recommendation in the eyes of his countrymen. His hatred of the
English was rooted and deadly. Never for a moment did he forget the
unjust invasion and insolent aggressions of those strangers. Never did
he forget his own personal wrongs and humiliation.</p>

<p>“Compelled by the inferiority of his countrymen in the weapons and
instruments of war, as by their customs, to employ stratagem instead of
force, he buried deep in his bosom all traces of the rage with which he
was agitated.</p>

<p>“To the English, if any faith was due to appearances, his deportment was
uniformly frank and unreserved. He was the equitable mediator in the
several differences which arose between them and his countrymen.</p>

<p>“The intellectual superiority of the white men was the constant theme of
his admiration. He appeared to consider them as the peculiar favorites
of heaven, against whom resistance were at once impious and
impracticable. But far different was his language and deportment in the
presence of his countrymen.</p>

<p>“In the gloom and silence of the dark and impenetrable forest, or the
inaccessible swamp, he gave utterance to the sorrows and indignation of
his swelling bosom. He painted with the strength and brilliancy of
savage coloring the tyranny, rapacity, and cruelty of the English; while
he mournfully contrasted the unalloyed content and felicity of their
former lives, with their present abject and degraded<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span> condition; subject
as they were to the capricious control and intolerable requisitions of
those hard and unpitying task-masters.</p>

<p>“Independence is the first blessing of the savage state. Without it, all
other advantages are light and valueless. Bereft of this, in their
estimation even life itself is a barren and comfortless possession. It
is not surprising then, that Opechancanough, independent of his
influence as a great Werowance or war captain, should, on such a
subject, discover kindred feelings in the breasts of his countrymen. The
war-song and war-whoop, breaking like thunder from the fierce and
barbarous multitudes, mingling with the clatter of their shields, and
enforced by the terrific gestures of the war-dance, proclaimed to their
leader their determination to die with him or conquer.</p>

<p>“With equal address the experienced and wily savage proceeded to allay
the storm which invective had conjured up in the breasts of the Indians.
The English, although experience had proved them neither immortal nor
invincible, he represented as formidable by their fire-arms, and their
superior knowledge in the art of war; and he inculcated, as the sole
means of deliverance and revenge, secrecy and caution until an occasion
should offer, when, by surprise or ambush, the scattered establishments
of their enemies might at the same moment be assaulted and swept away.</p>

<p>“Four years had nearly elapsed in maturing this formidable conspiracy;
during which time, not a single Indian belonging to the thirty nations,
which composed the empire of Powhatan, was found to violate his
engagements, or be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span>tray his leader. Not a word or hint was heedlessly or
deliberately dropt to awaken jealousy or excite suspicion.</p>

<p>“Every thing being at length ripe for execution, the several nations of
Indians were secretly drawn together, and stationed at the several
points of attack, with a celerity and precision unparalleled in history.
Although some of the detachments had to march from great distances, and
through a continued forest, guided only by the stars and the dubious
light of the moon, no instance of mistake or disorder took place. The
Indian mode of march is by single files. They follow one after another
in profound silence, treading nearly as possible in the steps of each
other, and adjusting the long grass and branches which they have
displaced. This is done to conceal all traces of their route from their
enemies, who are equally sagacious and quick-sighted. They halted at a
short distance from the English, waiting without impatience for the
signal which was to be given by their fellows, who, under pretence of
traffic, had this day in considerable numbers repaired to the
plantations of the colonists.</p>

<p>“So perfect was the cunning and dissimulation of Opechancanough, that on
the morning of this fatal day, the straggling English by his direction
were conducted in safety through the woods to their settlements, and
presents of venison and fowl were sent in his name to the governor and
counsellors, accompanied with expressions of regard and assurances of
friendship. ‘Sooner,’ said the wily chieftain, ‘shall the sky fall, than
the peace shall be violated on my part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span>’</p>

<p>“And so entirely were the English duped by these professions and
appearances, that they freely lent the Indians their boats, with which
they announced the concert, the signal and the hour of attack to their
countrymen on the other side of the river.</p>

<p>“The fatal hour having at length arrived, and the necessary dispositions
having every where taken place; on a signal given, at mid day,
innumerable detachments setting up the war-whoop, burst from their
concealments on the defenceless settlements of the English, massacreing
all they met, without distinction of age or sex; and according to custom
mutilating and mangling in a shocking manner the dead bodies of their
enemies.</p>

<p>“So unexpected and terrible was the onset, that scarcely any resistance
was made. The English fell scarcely knowing their enemies, and in many
instances by their own weapons. In one hour three hundred and
forty-seven men, women, and children, including six of the council and
several others of distinction, fell without a struggle, by the hands of
the Indians. Chance alone saved the colony from utter extirpation.</p>

<p>“A converted Indian, named Chanco, lived with Richard Pace, loved by his
master on account of his good qualities, with an affection at once
Christian and parental. The night preceding the massacre, the brother of
Chanco slept with him; and after a strict injunction of secrecy, having
revealed to him the intended plot, he commanded him, in the name of
Opechancanough, to murder his master. The grateful Indian, shocked at
the atrocity of the proposal, af<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span>ter his brother’s departure, flew to
Pace and disclosed to him the information he had received. There was no
time to be lost. Before day a despatch was forwarded to the governor at
Jamestown, which with the adjacent settlements was thus preserved from
the ruin that hung over them.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>“From this time the number of the plantations and settlements, which
before amounted to eighty, was reduced to six, and their strength
concentrated by order of the governor about Jamestown and the
neighborhood. All works of public utility, as well as the exertions of
private industry, were entirely suspended; and the whole attention of
the colonists was bent on the means of defence, and on projects of
vengeance. A bloody and exterminating war ensued, in which treachery and
cruelty took place of manly courage and generous warfare. The laws of
war, and that humanity, which in the moments of victory give quarter to
the vanquished, were forgotten amid the suggestions of craving and
insatiable revenge. But the opportunities of retaliation, owing to the
swiftness of the natives, were not frequent enough to appease the
boiling spirit of vengeance. The Indian, pressed by hunger, or
stimulated by the hope of plunder or revenge, would on a sudden burst
from his concealment on his enemy, and if outnumbered and pursued, he
vanished amid the eternal midnight of his forests. Whole days he lies on
his belly in breathless silence, his color not distinguishable from the
earth on which he lies, and every faculty wound up to attention. He
watches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span> moment when he can strike with certainty, and his aim is as
fatal and unerring as destiny.</p>

<p>“At last the Indians were invited from their fastnesses by the hopes of
peace and the solemn assurances of safety and forgiveness. That inhuman
maxim of the Roman Church, ‘that no faith is to be kept with heretics,’
appears to have been adopted by the colonists in its fullest force.</p>

<p>“The habitations of the unfortunate people were beset at the same
moment; and an indiscriminate slaughter took place, without regard to
age, sex, or infancy. The horrid scene terminated by setting fire to the
huts and corn of the savages.”</p>
